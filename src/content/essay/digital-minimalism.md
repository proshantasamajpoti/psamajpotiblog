We live in an age of infinite distractions. Every app, every notification, every algorithm is designed to capture our attention — and they're exceptionally good at it.

**Digital minimalism** isn't about rejecting technology. It's about being intentional with how we use it.

Here are a few principles I've found helpful:

1. **Curate ruthlessly** — Unfollow, unsubscribe, delete. If something doesn't add value, let it go.

2. **Create more than you consume** — Shift from passive scrolling to active creating. Write, build, make.

3. **Protect your attention** — Your attention is your most valuable resource. Guard it accordingly.

The irony of writing this on a digital platform isn't lost on me. Tools themselves are neutral. What matters is whether we control them, or they control us.
