Too much riled up with creating my blog and perfecting it. Eventually ended up in exhaustion and couldn't find a proper headless CMS tool. Or should I say an easy one that's understandable at my current knowledge level? But I should focus on my graduate journey right now, not getting a perfect blog from the day one. It a near impossible goal to target and a huge waste of the time I am passing right now!
